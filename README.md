### Profile of other users
A user must be able to consult the profile of other users. Profiles must contain all the
information available about them, (except for the personal details, like email address).
When a user consults a profile, it must appear in his/her visit history.
The user is also able to:
* Like another user (only if the current user have an avatar, otherwise, he/she cannot complete this action
). When two people “like” each other, we will say that they are **“match”** and are now able to chat. 

* See the “fame rating”
* See if the user is online, and if not see the date and time of the last connection.
* Report the user as a “fake account”.
* Block the user. A blocked user won’t appear anymore in the research results and
won’t generate additional notifications.

A user can clearly see if the consulted profile is connected or “like” his/her profile and
must be able to “unlike” or be disconnected from that profile.

### Chat
When two users are connected, they must be able to “chat” in real time. The user must be able to see from any page if
a new message is received.

### Notifications
A user must be notified in real time6 of the following events:

* The user received a “like”
* The user’s profile has been checked
* The user received a message
* A “liked” user “liked” back
* A connected user “unliked” you
